# Cloud Infrastructure Automation

This project demonstrates the use of Terraform to automate the provisioning of secure and scalable infrastructure. The project follows best practices for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and incorporates modular design with variables for flexibility and maintainability.

## Features

- **Modular Terraform Structure**: Infrastructure is provisioned using a modular structure with variables to enhance maintainability and scalability.
- **Secure and Scalable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure is built using best practices for security and scalability on AWS.
- **CI Integration**: Continuous integration (CI) with CircleCI is used for automating the infrastructure deployment process.
- **Git Version Control**: The project is tracked using Git for version control and collaboration.

## Technologies Used

- **Terraform**: Automates infrastructure provisioning with Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- **AWS**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides the cloud platform for deploying and managing the infrastructure.
- **CircleCI**: Used for continuous integration and automation of the deployment pipeline.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes and collaboration.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you need to have the following tools installed:

- **Terraform**: Make sure Terraform is installed on your local machine.
- **AWS Account**: Create an AWS account and set up the necessary credentials to use AWS services.
- **CircleCI Account**: Set up a CircleCI account and integrate it with your GitHub repository for continuous integration.
- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed to clone the repository and push changes.
